/// File overview:
/// Adapts Apple's on-device Foundation Models framework to Tabby's existing
/// `SuggestionGenerating` capability. The coordinator should not care whether suggestions come
/// from llama.cpp or Apple Intelligence; that backend choice belongs in app composition.
///
/// This engine creates a fresh `LanguageModelSession` per request. That is the right default for
/// Tabby's autocomplete flow because each suggestion is a single-turn interaction and we do not
/// want prior model responses to accumulate in the context window.
///
/// The important behavioral nuance is that Foundation Models has a dedicated instructions channel.
/// We use that to tell the system model "this is inline autocomplete, not a chat reply," because a
/// bare text prefix like "hello" otherwise invites conversational continuations.
