/// File overview:
/// Defines the behavior-shaped contracts that `SuggestionCoordinator` depends on.
///
/// These protocols are intentionally narrow. The goal is not "abstract everything"; the goal is
/// to describe the coordinator's collaborators by the capabilities it actually needs:
/// permission reads, focus snapshots, input events, suggestion generation, text insertion, and
/// legacy visual-context lifecycle callbacks.
///
/// This is a high-leverage maintainability move because `SuggestionCoordinator` is the app's
/// largest orchestration type. Depending on contracts instead of concrete classes makes the data
/// flow easier to understand today and gives a natural seam for tests later without changing
/// runtime behavior now.
